# Excitation curve

The final excitation function was determined after all applied conditions and cuts.
The number of events identified as pd -> (3He-eta)bound -> dppi0 in each excess energy interval was divided by the corresponding integrated luminosity L(Q) determined based on quasi-free proton-proton scattering and corrected for total efficiency.
